*"I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange..."*

## Usage
There is a field for adding a new task. The user should also set a duration (minutes, hours, days) and a place (anywhere, somewhere) where that task can be made. 

The tasks can be alphabetically ordered by 'time' and 'place'. There is also a progress counter, that can be adjusted with the arrows. Every task starts at 0%. The two buttons on the side of the tasks allow completion or deletion.

When a task is completed, Cooper says **HeLlLoO!** and gets a coffee. When the task is deleted, Laura says **MeAnWhIlE AaAaAaRrRG**. The task is automatically completed if the progress bar hits 100%.
